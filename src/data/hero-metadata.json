He collected electronic scrap in the landfill for a living but he realized a better way to earn it. He soon knew how to assemble the waste components into usable machines and then sell them for the extra margin. His business was profitable enough to make him became the richest person in ISO 998. His wealth, creativity and inventions helped him to rule the entire kingdom. One more thing to mention, KEO502 is narcissistic to the extreme.",
